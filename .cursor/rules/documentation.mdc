# Documentation Standards

## File Organization
- [README.md](mdc:README.md) - Main user-facing documentation
- [sven-install.md](mdc:sven-install.md) - Linux-specific installation
- `.docs/` directory - Extended documentation (optional)

## Documentation Structure

### README.md
Should contain:
1. **Project title and last update date**
2. **Brief description** - What the app does
3. **Latest version** - Which file is recommended
4. **Prerequisites** - System requirements
5. **Dependencies** - Python packages
6. **Setup instructions** - Step by step
7. **Building executables** - PyInstaller usage
8. **Running the app** - Usage instructions
9. **Notes** - Important technical details

### Installation Guides
Use bash code blocks for Linux commands:
```bash
# Comments explain what each command does
sudo apt install package-name
```

Include:
- System package installation
- Virtual environment setup
- Python package installation
- API key configuration
- Desktop launcher creation (optional)

## Code Comments

### File Headers
Each Python file should start with a comprehensive comment explaining:
- Purpose of the script
- Key libraries used
- Main functionality overview
- Special features or flags

Example from [whisperer-translate-to-dutch.py](mdc:whisperer-translate-to-dutch.py):
```python
# This script is a voice-to-text application that uses the OpenAI API to transcribe audio recordings.
# It imports necessary libraries for handling audio input, environment variables, and keyboard events.
# The script initializes global variables to manage the recording state, audio data, and other flags.
```

### Inline Comments
- Explain complex logic
- Document key bindings and their purposes
- Note platform-specific code
- Clarify global state management

## Version History
